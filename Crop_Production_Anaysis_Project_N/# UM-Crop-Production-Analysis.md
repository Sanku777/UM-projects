# UM-Crop-Production-Analysis

Completed during my Data Analyst Internship at Unified Mentor.

# Project Overview:

During my internship, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of a dataset focused on crop production across various states and districts in India. The dataset included details such as seasons, years, and areas under cultivation. My objective was to predict crop production trends and identify key factors influencing agricultural yields.

# Key Activities:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:
I utilized Power Query to clean the dataset by removing duplicates and ensuring data integrity. This step was crucial for maintaining the accuracy of the analysis.

Data Aggregation and Visualization:
I employed Pivot Tables, along with bar and doughnut charts in Excel, to perform data aggregation. This helped in summarizing the data and visualizing trends effectively.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Through EDA, I examined various factors affecting crop production. This analysis provided deep insights into how different variables, such as seasonality and geographic location, impact agricultural output.

Dynamic Dashboard Creation:
I designed a Dynamic Visualization Dashboard using Power BI to present the findings interactively. This dashboard allowed for a clear and engaging presentation of the data, making it easier to draw actionable insights.

# Key Insights:

Seasonal Impact:
The analysis revealed a strong correlation between crop production and seasonal patterns, with 59% of India's crop production occurring during the Kharif season (June-October).

Yearly Trends:
Significant increases in crop production were observed in 2011 (10% growth) and 2013 (9% growth).

Top Yielding Crops:
The highest yielding crops in India were identified as Coconut (92%), followed by Sugarcane (4%), and Rice and Wheat (1% each).

# Skills Gained:

This project honed my skills in descriptive analysis and expanded my proficiency with Excel, Power Query, and Power BI. Additionally, I enhanced my ability to create dynamic dashboards for interactive reporting, which deepened my analytical, presentation, and statistical skillsâ€”essential for my career as a Data Analyst.
